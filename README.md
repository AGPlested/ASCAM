ASCAM can be used to browse, organize and analize episodic recordings of single ion channel currents.

It has been built and requires python>=3.6. Further requirements can be found in 'requirements.txt' and installed with 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

A straightforward installation can be achieved by first installing Anaconda to get the necessary libraries. At the time of writing, a working version for Mac is https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg 

After successful installation, if you have Git installed, you can clone the ASCAM directory from Github onto your machine with the following command in the Terminal: git clone https://github.com/AGPlested/ASCAM. But if you had Git installed, you almost certainly knew that already. If you don't have Git, you can just copy ASCAM directory and then navigate to it directory.

Start ASCAM from within its own directory with the following command in the Terminal: ./ASCAM.py

There is an example raw data file in the ASCAM folder. This recording was sampled at 40 kHz.
