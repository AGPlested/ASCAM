ASCAM can be used to browse, organize and analyze episodic recordings of single ion channel currents.

Requires python>=3.6 and Numpy>=1.16 
Further required packages can be found in 'requirements.txt' and installed with 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

A straightforward installation can be achieved by first installing Anaconda to get the necessary libraries. At the time of writing, a working version for Mac is https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg 

After successful installation of Anaconda, if you have Git installed, you can clone the ASCAM directory from Github onto your machine with the following command in the Terminal: *git clone https://github.com/AGPlested/ASCAM*. But if you had Git installed, you almost certainly knew that already. 

If you don't have Git, you can just copy ASCAM directory and then navigate to it manually.

Start ASCAM from within its own directory by executing the file `run`. (Enter `./run` in the terminal)

There is an example raw data file of an AMPA receptor single channel patch in the ASCAM/data folder. This recording was sampled at 40 kHz.
