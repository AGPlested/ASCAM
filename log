added a scrollbar to the list of episode

tried resizing using the `grid_rowconfigure` method, not very succesful, only resized the plot in horizontal direction, nothing else

----------------------------------------------------------------------

changed the model to the new structure `Model>Series>Episode` to have better management, Model is a dict whose values are the Series which are lists containing episodes
filtering, baselining and all other manipulations that can be applied to a single episode are now episode methods, the series object has methods to apply each operation to all episodes in the series

modified the GUI code to work with the new model and hopefully be more general
started adding VERBOSE option for gui

------------------------------------------------------------------------

fixed a small problem in `analysis.baseline`, now properly accepts single intervals, and added support for time vectors in different units of seconds

wrote `threshold_crossing` which takes a signal and an arbitrary number of amplitudes and idealizes the signal to those amplitudes by assigning to each point of the signal the closest amplitude

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

removed `single_state_threshold_crossing` because crossing in two direction is not needed

added another `multilevel_threshold` that does threshold crossing for given thresholds rather than amplitudes, can take any number of thresholds and will idealize to linear spaced fraction of maximum amplitude
this function can also take absolute values for the thresholds

new filter function so only one function call from the model is required

started working on making series execute instruction when they are initialized

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

plot now resizes better, episode list also resizes and starts bigger

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

fixed it so that plot is again drawn when data is first loaded (was empty)

problem: plot seems to draw twice on first loading, creating an orange plot lying over the normal blue one
-fixed

episodeList now displays empty when program starts

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

started all-point histogram code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

working on support for `.mat` files

cannot load axograph data on another linux machine (don't know why)


NEXT: 
loading data from matlab file
creating all points histogram
connect filter button to filter function


TO DO: 
    - make the unit of current, voltage etc. a parameter in episode objects with default pA and mV
    - make something for sorting episodes
    - add a histogram to the side of the plot
    - implement gaussian mixture model for fitting the histogram
    - add a better toolbar to the plot
    - add units/labels to plots
    - fix resizing
    - interpolation in threshold crossing
    - amplitude estimation in threshold crossing
    - different basis functions for baseline corrention (e.g. cosine)


from discussion with jelena and sebastian:
all point histogram
-include time interval selection (either manual or automatic to piezo at maximum amplitude)

remove command voltage plot, add display avg and std of command voltage, or display warning if command voltage std is >1% of average
