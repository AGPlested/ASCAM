ISSUES:
    - does not update histogram after a new file is loaded when there was
    - does not plot all episode histogram if only list is selected
    - lists created before data is loaded cannot be used

Notes last meeting:
    for piezo voltage simultaneously show both inactive and active in
    histogram

    hotkey for zooming in y-scale of current
    zooming general?

    save in folder with time stamp
    log file (VERBOSE option and also a short form)
    we want to be able to reconstruct every step
    to save are lists as mat files


NEXT:
    - refactor gui.py and model.py into smaller modules and spread the whole
    thing over directories
    - toolbar
    - saving, one way to save everything
    - one way to save only episodes in lists
    - write a verbose log file
    - make axis range configurable
    - histogram on the side of plot
    - all episode histogram as line
    - display file name in gui
    - change episode list membership indicator from background color to
    something else (maybe checkmark after all or colored dots)
    - abstract the histogram creation out of the current function to make
    plotting multiple histograms more concise
    - create a gui attribute that is TRUE is data is loaded and false otherwise


TO DO:
    - move file type detection into `model` module
    - add button to call `check_standard_deviation` and color a list of
    episodes accordingly, maybe dialog to ask to which list to add it if there
    are already lists
    - add an entry field where the unit of time in the data can be specified
    - replace baselinemethod option with dropdown
    - make a class of mutually exclusive checkbox buttons
    - if filter button is pressed but data has already been filtered switch to
    the fitlered series
    - give the series in the dropdown menu shorter names
    - add `reconstruct` method to `series` that takes the input values of
    attributes and performs the corresponding operations
    - make the unit of current, voltage etc. a parameter in episode objects
     with default pA and mV
    - implement gaussian mixture model for fitting the histogram
    - add a better toolbar to the plot
    - interpolation in threshold crossing
    - amplitude estimation in threshold crossing
    - different basis functions for baseline corrention (e.g. cosine)
    - move plotting to a seperate module so that gui.py only ever uses
    `plt.show(x)`
    - remove command voltage plot, add display avg and std of command voltage,
    or display warning if command voltage std is >1% of average
    - look at resizing again

weird issues:
    - There is a warning when first clicking an episode (i.e. 2nd time the
    plots are drawn)
    "
    anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook/deprecation.py:106:

    it does not seem to matter, everything works fine. This so far only happend
    on my desktop
    - when the episodelist widget is in focus clicking anywhere outside the
    ASCAM window the following error is displayed
    "Traceback (most recent call last):
